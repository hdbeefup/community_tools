   Java Based Stormregion 4D Model Editor
                Version 0.1
               
4D Editor is written in Java and requires Java Runtime Environment; you can download it from www.java.com. This program displays 3d-graphics and it needs some dlls (java OpenGL binding).
Move the files from the "OpenGL Binding DLL Files (Read Info)" folder to your "system32" folder (by default "C:\WINDOWS\system32").  You can start the program just clicking on the "Java4d" coffee-cup icon, or from the "cmd" console by typing from the program's path:

java -jar "java4d.jar"
The command above displays the console, in which are displayed errors, messages etc (you can use it to report errors, bugs...) Other .jar files MUST be into the lib\ subdirectory.
