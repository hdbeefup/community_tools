miniterkep-minimap_tool.exe
With this exe, you can make a minitape that is compatible with SWINE with a 24-bit, 150 Ã— 150-bit bmp file. If you opened the exe, enter your path and wait until you're done converting. Then a map with a mini.hex file will be added to the top of the map to add the MINI size in the track / rescue.

Usage `drag file in compatible format`

meret.exe
Size.exe copies the track or resize size. To use it simply drag the file to the exe. It only works if the track / rescue is not opened in hexeditor and if there is no special character in its name outside the bracket.
